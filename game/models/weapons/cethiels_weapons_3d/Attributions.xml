This is a CC0 collection of 3D hand-painted style RPG swords and shields.

It is based on an awesome CC0 2D weapon collection by Cethiel. Check out his
patreon and Twitter and consider supporting him for making this possible!

I (Drummyfish) have created the 3D models based on selected 2D weapons from
Cethiel's collection and used them as textures as well. I release the models as
CC0 too.

There are 10 swords and 4 shields, each one in 3 color variants! The models are
low-poly, but the Blender file includes subdivided models if you need a
high-poly version.

If you want HD versions of the textures, become Cethiel's patreon and you will
get access to his works in HD, which can be used instead of the provided SD
textures -- this has been tested, as Cethiel kindly provided me with the HD
versions.
