<Description>
Additional collection of 7 high quality, low-poly common RPG items, each one carefully crafted, optimised, including normals, seams, UV mapping and hand-painted diffuse textures - each model has two textures to choose from! Plus there are four seamless ground textures! That makes for 18 different looking items in total.

Models were made with Blender, but are also provided in OBJ format, so that they are compatible with basically any software. The original Blender file is of course also provided and well readable.

The collection contains following models.

- house

- tree

- conifer

- rock

- well

- bridge

- sign

- ground textures: grass, dirt, sand and pavement

Models are very well usable in games or in low-poly art.

I publish this under CC0 so that you aren't burdened by anything and don't even have to credit me, but if you do, I'll be very glad :)
