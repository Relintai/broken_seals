The original assets have been modified!

This is the first installment of a set of magic icons.

Each spell comes in three power levels.  Additionally most spells have several (up to nine) color variations.  The colors were chosen for their distinctness, and to support and wide range of possible classes of magic and or damage types.  For instance the red version of the "enchant weapon" spell could be used to add fire damage to weapons.  Game designers can figure out how to best apply these art assets to their system.

Enchant Weapon:  9 colors
Protect:  9 colors
Evil Eye: 2 colors
Fireball: 4 colors
Heal: 3 colors
 
All icons are 256x256, but have been designed to be easily recognizable down to 32x32.

Look for more in January...

This is the Third installment of a set of magic icons.

Each spell comes in three power levels.  Additionally most spells have several (up to nine) color variations.  The colors were chosen for their distinctness, and to support and wide range of possible classes of magic and or damage types.  For instance the red version of the "enchant weapon" spell could be used to add fire damage to weapons.  Game designers can figure out how to best apply these art assets to their system.

This installment adds frames, in 10 styles, and several colors each.  Frames can be added over the icons to indicate magic class, spell type or whatever works for your project.

Explosion:  5 colors
Horror:  3 colors
Leaf: 4 colors
Runes: 4 colors
Wild: 4 colors
Wind: 4 colors
Frames: 10 colors, 10 styles (not all styles have all colors)
 
All icons are 256x256, but have been designed to be easily recognizable down to 32x32.

If you find these icons useful, I'd appreciate it if you send me a line, with a link to your project -- just to satisfy my curiosity.

Also I can probably be commissioned to extend or expand this set at a reasonable rate.
