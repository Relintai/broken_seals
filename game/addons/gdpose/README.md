# TODOs
Minimum work needed to make this more feasible:
- Add undo feature
- Improve bone selection menu
- Add option to add keyframe for selected bone

Nice to figure out:
- Make it possible to select bones by clicking on them
- Make a better widget for rotations
- Add code to determine correct direction of rotation
