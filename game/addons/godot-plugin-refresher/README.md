# godot-plugin-refresher

This plugin simplifies plugin development for those wanting to make tools for the Godot Editor.

It adds a dropdown and refresh button to the toolbar. *Other* plugins' directory names will show up in the dropdown, and clicking the refresh button will simply toggle the plugin off and then back on.

This makes it much easier to iterate on a single plugin since rather than having to...

1. Click Project Settings.
2. Go to Plugins tab (first time).
3. Find the desired plugin.
4. Click the dropdown.
5. Select the opposite option.
6. Click the dropdown again.
7. Click the original option.
8. Close the Project Settings.

You instead just...

1. Click the dropdown (first time).
2. Select your WIP plugin (first time).
3. Click the refresh button.
